We provide two versions of the dataset. The main dataset is in the country-year format. In this dataset, when several heads of government were in office in the same year, the dataset only includes the head of
government that was in office during the greater part of that year. We also provide a second dataset, which is in the leader-year format (similar to the structure of the Archigos dataset; see Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009), but we do not provide new data on ideology for leaders who were only in power for a small part of one year.
